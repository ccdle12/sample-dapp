# sample-dapp
Sample Dapp that includes a private chain, contracts, tests and a front end.

My intention is to package this up to a scaffold project to create future dapps quickly.

Setup

``` git clone ``` 

``` npm install ```

``` geth --datadir "./data" --rpc --networkid 100 console```

```cd truffle ```

``` ./tcm.sh ```
